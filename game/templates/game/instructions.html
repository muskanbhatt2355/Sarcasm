		<li>Visit the forum to get hints which we post periodically according to the time and need.</li>
		<li>Each question can be answered multiple times, so be liberal with your guesses.</li>
		<li>Refrain from posting the answers on the forum which can result in the ban of that user. </li>
		<li>In the interests of the spirit of the competition, avoid solving in groups or giving answers away for love or money. The game will be thrilling to the player the most when played alone. SARCasm can be scathing, but it loses its sting if shared with too many people. :)</li>
		<li>The desire for fame tempts even the noblest of minds. We at SARC are no exception. Please do like us on our FB page, to stay connected for more awesome events.
